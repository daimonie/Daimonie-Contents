\section{Welcome!} 


To \emph{Daimonie.com}, a website accompanying \href{https://www.facebook.com/daimonie}{my Facebook Page} and \href{./blog"}{my Blog}.

I am a graduate of Delft University of Technology, having completed the Master of Science programme in Physics, specialising towards Quantum Condensed Matter Physics. I am also a somewhat accomplished programmer and a lover of science in general. I also fervently believe in the value of widespread scientific literacy, resulting in some science activism. 

My pseudonym is Daimonie, \href{https://goo.gl/xwLXc1}{an ancient Greek} word that I first saw used in  the context of "extraordinary one", in Homer's Illiad.  It was used by Helen of Troy to address a magically disguised Aphrodite, goddess of love. The word is also part of the word for \href{https://goo.gl/kktWCr}{Spartan}, and has \href{https://goo.gl/sKxvMo}{Demon as a derived term}. As you can see, it is an interesting word, even if I did first translate it as 'weirdo'.

I have noted that there is some confusion among readers regarding my current status. I have a M. Sc. degree in Physics, so that I should be allowed to refer to myself as a physicist. I am currently employed at a university. I understand that I have an international audience, so let me shortly detail education in the Netherlands. In high school, we have multiple levels, one of which prepares for an academic tertiary education. Academic tertiary education starts with a Bachelor of three years followed by a Master of two years. After the Master, one can pursue a PhD degree, which is a paid position. The Master of Science degree is a postgraduate degree.


\section{Contents}  
This website contains several pages. I will explain each of them.

The first page, \weblink{origins}{Origins} is a long story of the known history of the universe. It is the story of origins, explaining how we got from the Big Bang to human life and ingenuity.

The second page, \weblink{sceptic}{Sceptic} explains one of my common time-sinks: discussion with conspiracy theorists and science deniers. They're not exactly the same, but conversation with them often feels like that. It also explains why this is one of my time-sinks.

The third page, \weblink{science}{Science} describes the scientific method and attitude. It also elaborates on the difference between Historical and Observational science.

The fourth page, \weblink{share}{Share} is a repository of files I share to the web. This includes PDF versions of each page, but also attachments, short blog articles and resources used in blogs. 

The fifth page, \weblink{blog}{Blog} is a gateway to my blog. It contains a short preview list of each article, including a short description.

Finally, I wanted to warn you. Sometimes, you will see something like this: \cite{crediblehulk}. This is a citation or reference. You can find the reference by clicking it, which opens a bottom sheet with the necessary information.
